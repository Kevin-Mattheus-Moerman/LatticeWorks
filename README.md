This is a MATLAB toolbox for creating and customizing lattice structures, multi-morphology lattices, and lattices in different coordinates and arrangements. 

# Getting started
## Installation
To install this toolbox, simply run `install_me.m` found in the main project folder. 

Alternatively one can manually install by adding `lib` and `lib_ext` folders to the path. 

### Install dependancies
* Install the [GIBBON MATLAB toolbox](https://www.gibboncode.org/)
* Required MATLAB toolboxes:
	- Image Processing toolbox
Optional functionality
* ABAQUS, to run finite element simulations through ABAQUS
* [FEBio](https://www.febio.org/), to run finite element simulations through FEBio (see also configuration information with the GIBBON toolbox)
* [export_fig](https://github.com/altmany/export_fig), to fascilitate the creation of publication quality figures. 

## Running examples
Examples are contained in the `docs` folder.
